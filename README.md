# Juris-MPortable
Juris-M in PortableApps.com Format


  
Why?
-----
Just like there's a Portable Zotero, there's now a Portable Juris-M.
  
How to use:
-----
- Download latest [release here](https://github.com/pedrom34/JurisMPortable/releases/latest)
- Unpack JurisM by launching installer and selecting target folder (it can be an USB Key or a folder on your desktop...)
- Install [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/) in your browser (I personnaly use [FirefoxPortable](https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable/localization))
- You're all set.
